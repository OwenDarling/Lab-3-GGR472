GGR472 Lab #3

This lab uses functions such as zoom functions, search functions, layers, and toggeling layers.
Using listners this web map is able to select and deselect certian provinces, along with having the option to put that province in the main field of view.
Expanding on the map from lab 2 there is still an option to zoom to the POI's that were focused on in. 
The search function will bring the user to the item that they searched, along with adding a point onto the map for the duration of the search.
Population data and legend are associated with checkboxes and will appear when checked.
